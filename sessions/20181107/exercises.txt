Using lists and sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on exercises from the NLTK book chapter 1:

1. What is the difference between the following two lines? Which one will give a larger value?

>>> sorted(set(w.lower() for w in some_list_of_words))
>>> sorted(w.lower() for w in set(some_list_of_words))

The first one will print out each element in lowercase in the word list with sorted order.
The second one will print out unique element in lowercase in the word list with sorted order.
The second one will might give a larger value if there are some same words in the list. Because set means only
contains unique element.

2. Using list addition, and the set and sorted operations, compute the vocabulary of a list of sentences.

def vocabulary(sentences)
  tokens=[]
  for s in sentences:
      tokens.extend[nltk.word_tokenize(s)]
  return sorted(set([t.lower() for t in tokens if t.isalpha()]))
   

3. Write the slice expression that extracts the last three words of a string.

def vocabulary2(s)
  return nltk.word_tokenize(s)[-3:]
